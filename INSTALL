= Installing clibsedml from source

There are two ways to install clibsedml from source: by Autotools and by CMake.

* By Autotools (recommended for Linux or macOS)
  Please make sure that the following tools are installed:
  - autoconf 2.59 or higher
  - automake 1.10 or higher
  - gcc 4.2.1 or higher
  - GNU Make 3.81 or higher
  With the source at /path/to/clibsedml, the steps look like:
  $ cd /path/to/clibsedml
  $ autoreconf -i -f
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ ../configure --prefix="..."
  $ make all
  $ make install

* By CMake (for Windows)
  You need CMake 3.5 or later for this option.
  We have tested building clibsedml with Visual Studio 2015.
  With the source at /path/to/clibsedml, the steps look like:
  $ cd /path/to/clibsedml
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="..." ..
  $ cmake --build .
  $ cmake --build . --target install
